# TX Question Style Benchmark (Feb 2026)

## Purpose
Define a rubric for assessing and improving question quality in the TX DMV practice question bank. Guide rewriting from definition-recall toward assessment-grade scenario-driven questions.

## Scoring Rubric (5 dimensions, 1–5 each)

### 1. Clarity (1–5)
| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Ambiguous or confusing wording; multiple interpretations possible |
| 2 | Meaning is guessable but uses jargon without context |
| 3 | Clear but overly simple or generic phrasing |
| 4 | Clear, concise stem with enough context to answer without guessing |
| 5 | Scenario-driven stem that contextualizes the rule in a real driving situation |

### 2. Legal Accuracy (1–5)
| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Contains factual errors or contradicts Texas law |
| 2 | Vague or incomplete statement of the rule |
| 3 | Technically correct but lacks specificity (e.g., "Texas law requires..." without citation) |
| 4 | Correct with specific reference to DL-7, Transportation Code, or MUTCD section |
| 5 | Correct, specific, and teaches the "why" behind the rule |

### 3. Distractor Quality (1–5)
| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Distractors are absurd or clearly wrong (e.g., "Parking for white vehicles only") |
| 2 | One distractor is plausible; others are obviously wrong |
| 3 | Two distractors are plausible; one is obviously wrong |
| 4 | All distractors are plausible but clearly distinguishable from the correct answer |
| 5 | All distractors are legally adjacent — a learner who hasn't studied the rule could reasonably pick any |

### 4. Instructional Value (1–5)
| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Tests rote memorization of a single fact with no teaching value |
| 2 | Tests recall but the explanation is just a restatement |
| 3 | Tests understanding; explanation adds some context |
| 4 | Tests application; explanation teaches the reasoning behind the rule |
| 5 | Tests judgment in a realistic scenario; explanation connects rule to safety outcome |

### 5. Scenario Depth (1–5)
| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Pure definition question ("What does X mean?") |
| 2 | Definition with slight context ("When you see X, what should you do?") |
| 3 | Simple scenario with one variable ("You are driving and...") |
| 4 | Multi-factor scenario requiring rule application ("You are on a two-lane road in rain...") |
| 5 | Complex judgment scenario with competing rules or realistic edge case |

## Weak vs. Strong Examples

### Example 1: PARKING

**WEAK (Score: 1/2/1/2/1 = 7/25)**
```
Q: What is the minimum distance you must park from a fire hydrant?
A. 15 feet ✓
B. 10 feet
C. 20 feet
D. 25 feet
Explanation: You must park at least 15 feet away from a fire hydrant.
```
Problems: Pure recall of a number. Distractors are just nearby numbers. No scenario. Explanation restates the answer.

**STRONG (Score: 5/5/4/5/4 = 23/25)**
```
Q: You find a parking spot on a busy street, but notice a fire hydrant 12 feet away. What should you do?
A. Find another spot — you must park at least 15 feet from a hydrant ✓
B. Park there since 12 feet provides enough clearance for fire trucks
C. Park there but leave your hazard lights on
D. Park there only if you'll be gone less than 5 minutes
Explanation: Texas law requires at least 15 feet of clearance from fire hydrants (DL-7). At 12 feet, you'd be in violation. This buffer ensures fire crews can quickly connect hoses without moving parked vehicles. The fine for blocking a hydrant can exceed $200.
Reference: Texas Transportation Code §545.302; DL-7 Parking Rules
```
Improvements: Scenario-driven stem with a specific measurement to evaluate. Distractors test common misconceptions. Explanation teaches the safety rationale and consequence.

### Example 2: TRAFFIC SIGNALS

**WEAK (Score: 2/3/2/2/1 = 10/25)**
```
Q: What does a solid red traffic light mean?
A. Stop completely and remain stopped until green ✓
B. Stop, then proceed if clear
C. Slow down and proceed with caution
D. Yield to oncoming traffic
```
Problems: Trivially easy. Option B (flashing red behavior) is the only plausible distractor.

**STRONG (Score: 5/5/5/5/4 = 24/25)**
```
Q: You're approaching an intersection and the light turns red just as you reach the stop line. A pedestrian is in the crosswalk to your right, and you want to turn right. What should you do?
A. Stop at the line, wait for the pedestrian to clear, then turn right when safe ✓
B. Stop, then immediately turn right behind the pedestrian
C. Wait for the light to turn green before turning
D. Proceed through the turn since the pedestrian is on the far side
Explanation: At a red light, you must first stop completely at the stop line. Right turns on red are permitted in Texas unless posted otherwise, but you must yield to all pedestrians in the crosswalk first — regardless of which direction they're walking (DL-7). Turning behind a pedestrian is dangerous because they may hesitate or reverse direction.
Reference: Texas Transportation Code §544.007(d); DL-7 Traffic Signals
```

### Example 3: PAVEMENT MARKINGS

**WEAK (Score: 2/3/1/2/1 = 9/25)**
```
Q: Which color line separates traffic moving in opposite directions?
A. Yellow ✓  B. White  C. Red  D. Blue
```

**STRONG (Score: 5/5/4/5/4 = 23/25)**
```
Q: You're driving on a two-lane road and see a solid yellow line on your side with a dashed yellow line on the other side. What does this mean for you?
A. You may not pass, but oncoming traffic may pass when safe ✓
B. Both directions may pass when safe
C. Neither direction may pass
D. You may pass, but oncoming traffic may not
Explanation: When a double yellow center line has one solid and one dashed line, the rule applies to each side independently. Drivers next to the solid line may not pass; drivers next to the dashed line may pass when safe. This asymmetric marking is used on roads where sight distance differs by direction.
Reference: MUTCD Section 3B.04; DL-7 Pavement Markings
```

## Target Quality Thresholds

| Dimension | Minimum for rewrite | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Clarity | 4 | 5 |
| Legal Accuracy | 4 | 5 |
| Distractor Quality | 4 | 4+ |
| Instructional Value | 4 | 5 |
| Scenario Depth | 3 | 4+ |
| **Total** | **19/25** | **23/25** |

## Source References (Allowed)
1. **Texas DPS Driver Handbook (DL-7)** — primary authority for all rules
2. **Texas Transportation Code** — statutory basis for rules (e.g., §545 Rules of the Road)
3. **FHWA MUTCD 11th Edition** — sign shapes, colors, meanings, placement
4. **Official TX DPS sample tests** — style benchmarking only (no verbatim copying)

## Rewrite Process
1. Identify the core rule being tested
2. Create a realistic driving scenario that requires applying the rule
3. Write 3 plausible but incorrect distractors based on common misconceptions
4. Write an explanation that teaches the rule AND the safety rationale
5. Include specific source reference
6. Increase difficulty by 1 level (cap at 3 for previously d=1 questions)
